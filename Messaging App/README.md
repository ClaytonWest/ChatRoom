Concurrency (Single Core) Vs Parallel Execution(Multi-Core)

-- Concurrency: running two or more programs in overlapping time phases.
  <!--At any given time, there is only one process in execution  -->

--Parallel Execution:tasks performed by a process are broken down into sub-parts
and multiple CPUS execute each sub-task at the same time. 
<!-- At any given time, all processes are being executed -->
<!-- Found in systems having multicore processesors -->
